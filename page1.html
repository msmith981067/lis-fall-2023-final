             Like pumpkin pie, pumpkin roll is a classic fall dessert.

         <h3>Instructions</h3><br>
            Read the instructions through before beginning. Make sure you are prepared for step 7 immediately when the cake comes out of the oven!<br>
            Preheat oven to 350°F.<br>
            Spray a 10×15-inch baking pan with nonstick spray or grease with butter, so the parchment paper sticks.<br>
            Line it with parchment paper so the cake seamlessly releases in step 5.<br>
            Spray or grease the parchment paper too. We want an extremely nonstick surface for this cake roll.<br>
            Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.<br>
            In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, pumpkin, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and vanilla together until combined.<br>
            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined.<br>
            Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Give the pan a shake to make sure the batter is level and reaches the corners.<br>
            Bake for 17–18 minutes, or until the cake springs back when you poke it with a finger.<br>
            Lay a thin kitchen towel flat on the counter.<br>
            Sprinkle with 3/4 cup confectioners’ sugar.<br>
            Once the cake comes out of the oven, immediately invert it onto the towel.<br>
            Peel off the parchment paper, then, starting with the narrow end, begin rolling the cake up with the towel.<br>
            Do this slowly and gently.<br> 
            The cake will be warm, as it just came out of the oven.<br>
            Allow the cake to cool completely while rolled up in the towel.<br>
            I stick mine in the refrigerator for about 2 hours to speed it up.<br>
            Remove the cake roll from the refrigerator and allow to sit on the counter for a few minutes to warm back up a bit as you prepare the frosting.<br>
         <h3>Make the Frosting:</h3><br>
            In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese for 1 minute on high speed until completely smooth and creamy.<br>
            Beat in the butter until combined.<br>
            Add the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy.<br>
            Gently and slowly unroll the cake. Flatten it out and spread frosting evenly on top, leaving about a 1/2-inch border around the cake.<br>
            Gently and slowly roll the cake back up, without the towel this time. Make sure you’re rolling it tightly. Some frosting may spill out the sides—that’s ok!<br>
            Loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.<br>
            Dust with more confectioners’ sugar, if desired.<br>
